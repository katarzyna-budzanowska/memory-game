## How To Play
Click on a cards to find 8 pairs of identical symbols. Each time you can flip only 2 cards. If the cards match, they will change color, but if they don't match, they will hide again.

### Score
Remember, your time is running and moves are counted! Try to score 3 stars and finish the game in less than 15 moves. Between 15 and 24 moves you'll get 2 stars and between 25 and 34 moves you'll get 1 star. But if you'll have more than 34 moves, you won't get any star.

Try it out and have fun!
